Peeranart Kiddee et al., 2013[10]. They summarize that e-waste is one of the
fastest-growing pollution problems worldwide due to its toxic substances and potential
environmental and human health impacts. Management strategies include eco-design
devices, properly collect and recycle material, dispose of e-waste by suitable
techniques, forbid the transfer of used electronic devices to developing countries, and
raise awareness of the impact. E-waste is a growing problem due to consumer
technology changing and rapid obsolescence, resulting in massive amounts of ewaste. It consists of many different materials, some of which contain toxic substances that can contaminate the environment. E-waste is a large variety of materials that
contain toxic substances that can contaminate the environment and threaten human
health. There is inadequate legislation worldwide for effective management of such
waste, leading to inappropriate management strategies in both developed and
developing countries. E-waste disposal methods include landfill and incineration, both
of which pose considerable contamination risks. Management of e-waste by recycling
and by disposal to landfills has been shown to pose significant risks to the
environment.

Aditya Vijayvargiya and Mr. Kapil Sahu, 2016[1]. E-waste is an inevitable
by-product of a technological revolution, with 5-7 million tons of electronics becoming
obsolete every year. It accounts for 1-4% of the municipal solid waste stream. E-waste
is discarded electronics destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling or disposal,
which can lead to adverse health effects and environmental pollution. Recycling and
disposal of e-waste involves significant risk for workers and communities in developing
countries. Technical solutions need to be implemented before a technical solution can
be applied. E-waste is a potential security threat, exposing sensitive information such
as credit card numbers, private financial data, account information, and records of
online transactions. E-waste is discarded electronics destined for reuse, resale,
salvage, recycling or disposal, which can lead to adverse health effects and
environmental pollution. E-waste is processed by melting circuit boards, burning cable
sheathing, and open pit acid leaching, but the recycling efficiency is low. Reform is
needed to provide a more environmentally friendly and socially conscious alternative.

Navjot Kaur and Gagandeep Singh, 2016[8]. The author says that green
computing is a global effort to minimize its impact on the environment, and this paper
provides a review of the literature and preventive measures to save the atmosphere.
Green computing is a branch of environmental science that enables the responsible
use of computer resources, servers and its associated subsystems. It is an ecofriendly information technology and communication technique that can reduce th
harmful effects of human activity on the atmosphere. In today's world, there is a
significant increase in the complexity and integration of systems which causes an
increase in power consumption of the system. To save the environment, it is important
to design power efficient circuits and convey the energy losses to the common man.
Another landmark in green computing history is the adoption of RoHS that is
Restriction of hazardous substance and electrical and electronic equipment directive.
Government organizations provide power and energy management programs to
protect the environment and promote green computing. This review provides an
overview on importance of green computing. Green computing has gain lot of
importance due to rise in power consumption and its impact on environment. Going
green is very beneficial as it helps various industries to manage their E-waste in an
efficient way so that the surrounding may not be affected. This paper suggested some
beneficial tips that we should follow from today or even from now for greener tomorrow.

Richa Pandey et al., 2017[11]. They summarize that green computing is the
study of designing and decomposing computers in a way that does not harm the
environment. It aims to reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize energy
efficiency, and reduce factory waste. Green computing is a trend that can help save
the earth by reducing the use of paper and reducing the cost and scarcity of energy.
Green technology aims to reduce the environmental impact of industrial processes by
testing and applying alternative non-hazardous materials. Cloud computing is the
latest trend in the emerging field of green computing. It does away with hardware
servers and uses virtual servers. It can be used for various computing techniques such
as energy saving by using power management and surge protectors. It can also be
used in other areas such as saving paper by sending email and printing content in
smaller fonts. Challenges in green computing include equipment power density,
increasing energy requirements, control on increasing requirements of heat removing
equipment, equipment life cycle management, and disposal of electronic wastes.

Ms. Simmi Chawla and Mr. Tarun Dalal, 2017[13]. In their research work
they discuss that green computing is the study and practice of efficient and eco-friendly
computing resources development. It is not only the responsibility of companies to
make eco-friendly components, but also of people. Awareness about Green IT &
Energy Star program can play a crucial role in adoption of Green Computing.
According to a report, e-wastage system will be the most growing sector in IT in 2020,
so technologies are asking for improvement and new innovations such as recycling of
plastics, metals, mixed metals and plastics, and toxic acids. Recycling of outdated
computers and software is a big challenge. Recycling is a key factor in Green IT, as it
is a convenient and environmentally responsible way to dispose of used or unwanted
electronic equipment. However, earlier computers have toxic materials and
components which can emit harmful emissions. Evolution of computer technology is
in progress, so old and unused computers become e-wastage.

B.M. Gupta et al., 2018[3]. The main focus is on electronic waste, commonly
referred to as e-waste, is one of the fastest growing segments in the municipal solid
waste stream. Rapid product replacement, especially for information and
communication technology (ICT) products and consumer equipment, is fuelling the
increase. According to the UN, more than 33% increase in electronic waste is
expected in the coming four years. Major regions across the globe generating e-waste
are the US, Europe and Asia Pacific. E-waste has been linked to a variety of health
problems, including cancer, neurological and respiratory disorders, and birth defects.
One of the objectives of this paper is to study and analyse global research output by
broad subject areas and the dynamics of research growth and decline. This study
provides a quantitative and qualitative description of e-waste research over a 10-year
period from 2007 to 2016.

Hitesh Monga, 2018[5]. The author says that green computing is the
environmentally sustainable use of computers and related resources to reduce the use
of risky materials, maximize energy efficiency, and promote the recyclability of outdated products and factory waste. It reduces energy usage, reduces carbon dioxide emissions, and protects resources. It also includes changing government policy to
boost recycling and lowering energy use. Green computing is essential to protect the
environment, as computer penetration is increasing globally and every step consumes
energy. All stake holders must work together to create a healthier and greener
environment for future generations. Green computing aims to reduce hazardous
materials, maximize energy efficiency, and promote recyclability or biodegradability.
This study examines the current trends in green computing, its implications, and the
challenges for implementing it.

Vanthana. N, 2018[14]. Author says that Green computing is the process of
designing, manufacturing, using and disposing of computers, server and associated
subsystems efficiently with minimal impact on the environment. It is becoming
increasingly important due to growing computing needs, energy cost and global
warming. Computing is both part of the problem and part of the solution in terms of the
environmental debate, as it can enable individuals and businesses to adopt greener
lifestyles and workstyles. Through more environmentally aware usage, such as more
effective power management and shut-down during periods of inactivity, and adopting
current lower power technologies, computers can be made significantly more energy
efficient. However, it is not a good thing that most PCs have typically entered a landfill
after only a few years in service, but this reality does at least mean that a solution can
be found. The IT industry is putting efforts in all sectors to achieve Green Computing,
such as equipment recycling, reduction of paper usage, virtualization, cloud
computing, power management, and green manufacturing. Government regulations
are pushing vendors to act green, behave green, do green, go green, think green, use
green, and reduce energy consumptions.

Dr. Neha Garg and Deepak Kumar Adhana, 2019[9]. The present paper
highlights the scenario of e-waste in India and other parts of the globe, and compares
it with other countries. It reveals that computers and mobile telephones are the
principal generators, with Mumbai generating an estimated 1, 20,000 tonnes annually.
Delhi and Bengaluru ranked second and third, respectively. State-wise Maharashtra
is ranked first in generation of electronic waste, followed by Tamil Nadu and Uttar
Pradesh. Approximately 70% of heavy metals found in landfills are accounted for by
E-waste. The paper also offers suggestions to deal with the Challenges and problems
of electronic waste. E-waste contains toxic substances that can lead to damage to
major body systems, particularly in the informal sector. Major Challenges of waste
management in India is also been described in the paper. The main thing we need to
Do a thorough search and research to find a registered agency to dispose of e-waste,
explore retail options, and encourage neighbours to join you. Resolve to be part of the
solution and help make the earth a better place to live.
