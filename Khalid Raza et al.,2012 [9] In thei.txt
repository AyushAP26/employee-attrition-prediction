Khalid Raza et al.,2012 [9] In their research work they discuss about The
manufacturing of electronic components and computers consumes energy, raw
materials, chemicals, and generates hazardous waste, leading to increased
carbon dioxide emissions. Human activities are altering the carbon cycle by adding
more CO2 to the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. The
imbalance in the composition of air can cause disastrous consequences like rising
sea levels, droughts, floods, and extreme weather conditions. Information and
communication technology (ICT) is contributing to environmental problems such
as global warming and climate change, and it is predicted to increase. Green
computing has emerged as an initiative for eco-friendly and sustainable IT. The
industries worldwide need to review their environmental credentials to address the
issue of global warming and climate change.

Govind Mishra and Venkat Ramanan, 2014 [6] the main focus is on the Green
computing is about making computers in an environmentally friendly way, from
start to finish. Carbon dioxide and other emissions from computers are hurting the
environment, so it's important to reduce them. Researchers are finding ways to
make computers that don't harm the environment, like using non-toxic materials
and making them energy efficient. This is important because energy costs are
going up and we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A study predicts that
the internet industry could produce a lot of greenhouse gases, but we can use
smart technology to reduce them. It's really important to take care of the
environment, and we can do that by making computers in a better way.




Cengiz Taplamacioglu, 2015 [4] the author states that Accurate electricity
consumption forecasting is crucial for energy planning in developing countries.
Support vector machines (SVMs) and least squares support vector machines (LS-
SVMs) are being used for energy consumption forecasting. This study uses LS-
SVM to predict Turkey's electricity energy consumption, with traditional regression
analysis and artificial neural networks (ANNs) also considered. Historical data from
1970 to 2009, including gross electricity generation, installed capacity, total
subscribership, and population, are used as independent variables. Forecasting
results are compared using diverse performance criteria, with ROC analysis used
to determine the specificity and sensitivity of empirical results. The study concludes
that the proposed LS-SVM model is an accurate and quick prediction method for
electricity consumption forecasting.
