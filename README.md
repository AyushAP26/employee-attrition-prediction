This project will predict employee attrition using a Random Forest Classifier. It includes various attributes about employees, such as age, job role, overtime status, and monthly income, along with the target variable: whether an employee has actually left the company. It deals with preprocessing data that involves encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier is trained, and cross-validation is performed to evaluate the classifier, ensuring consistency in its performance across various data splits. The model achieves an accuracy score of 87%, which validates its efficacy in predicting employee attrition. The project also visualizes employee attrition counts in a bar chart with absolute values and percentages for easier interpretation. This project aims to provide actionable insights into employee retention trends and can be extended further by handling data imbalances and experimenting with other machine learning models. It will be particularly useful for HR departments and organizations to predict employee turnover, enabling them to take proactive measures in employee retention, optimize resource management, and improve organizational stability.
